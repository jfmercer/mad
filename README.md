# My Awesome Dotfiles
This is a collection of my dotfiles. I hope you find them as helpful as I do. 

## Installation
Clone the respository, and then symlink the files to the home directory. I plan
to add a script later on to automate the symlink process. 

## Credits
I lean very heavily on the work of these outstanding gentlemen
* [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/) and his [outstanding collection of
